<h1>DM18-Toy-Problems</h1>

This repository is for the storage of and reference to toy problems for use in DevMountain's morning toy problem workshops.

The toy problems below are separated by week, providing both a beginner and advanced option depending on the level of experience of your students. We have also provided a link to solution pages (feel free to add any clever or unique solutions to these problems that you encounter).

Also feel free to add any additional toy problems to this repo, under the "Miscellaneous" section, if you believe they would be good additions to the toy problems rotation. Just be sure to provide a link to both a question page and a solutions page, in a similar format to the below.
